# Master-Thesis
This repository contains code used in my Master's thesis. The file fine-tuning-wav2vec2.py was used to fine-tune the Wav2vec2 models, it is inpired by the code from Huggingface blog https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-wav2vec2-english. The file fine-tuning-whisper.py was used to fine-tune the Whisper models, it is inspired by the code from Huggingface blog https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-whisper.

The file modify_transcriptions.py is a small script to modify predicted transcriptions due to the models tendency do not trasncribe "qqq", "mmm" and "eee" correctly.
All models can be found in Huggingface: https://huggingface.co/Tflatval
